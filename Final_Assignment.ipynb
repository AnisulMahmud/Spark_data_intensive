    "The basic task 1 is a warming up task and it deals with some video game sales data. The task asks you to do some basic aggregation operations with Spark data frames.\n",

    "The other basic tasks (basic tasks 2-7) are all related and deal with data from [https://moneypuck.com/data.htm](https://moneypuck.com/data.htm) that contains information about every shot in all National Hockey League ([NHL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League), [ice hockey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey)) matches starting from season 2011-12 and ending with the last completed season, 2022-23. The tasks ask you to calculate the results of the matches based on the given data as well as do some further calculations. Knowledge about ice hockey or NHL is not required, and the task instructions should be sufficient in order to gain enough context for the tasks.\n",

    "There are in total of three additional tasks that can be done to gain some course points.\n",

    "\n",
    "The other two additional tasks are separate tasks and do not relate to any other basic or additional tasks. One of them asks you to load in unstructured text data and do some calculations based on the words found from the data. The other asks you to utilize the K-Means algorithm to partition the given building data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to gain partial points from the additional tasks. I.e., if you have not completed the task fully but have implemented some part of the task, you might gain some appropriate portion of the points from the task.\n"

    "\n",
    "- Capitalization is to be ignored. I.e., words \"English\", \"ENGLISH\", and \"english\" are all to be considered as the same word \"english\".\n",
    "- An English word should only contain the 26 letters from the alphabet of Modern English. Only exception is that punctuation marks, i.e. hyphens `-`, are allowed in the middle of the words as long as there are no two consecutive punctuation marks without any letters between them.\n",
    "- The only allowed 1-letter English words are `a` and `i`.\n",
    "- A Finnish word should follow the same rules as English words, except that three additional letters, `å`, `ä`, and `ö`, are also allowed, and that no 1-letter words are allowed. Also, any word that contains \"`wiki`\" should not be considered as Finnish word.\n",

    "- Using an RDD or a Dataset (in Scala) might make the data cleaning and word determination easier than using DataFrames.\n",

    "- You are allowed to remove all non-allowed characters from the source data at the beginning of the cleaning process.\n",
    "- It is advisable to first create a DataFrame/Dataset/RDD that contains the found words, their language, and the number of times those words appeared in the articles. This can then be used as the starting point when determining the answers to the given questions.\n"

    "[K-Means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) algorithm is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to partition the input data into k clusters. Your task is to use the Spark ML library and its K-Means clusterization algorithm to divide the buildings into clusters using the building coordinates `latitude_wgs84` and `longitude_wgs84` as the basis of the clusterization. You should implement the following procedure:\n",

    "5. Find the cluster center for the chosen cluster of buildings.\n",
    "6. Calculate the largest distance from a building in the chosen cluster to the chosen cluster center. You are given a function `haversine` that you can use to calculate the distance between two points using the latitude and longitude of the points.\n",
    "7. While the largest distance from a building in the considered cluster to the cluster center is larger than 3 kilometers run the K-Means algorithm again using the following substeps.\n",
    "    - Run the K-Means algorithm to divide the remaining buildings into smaller clusters. The number of the new clusters should be one less than in the previous run of the algorithm (but should always be at least two). I.e., the sequence of `k` values starting from the second run should be 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, ...\n",
    "    - After using the algorithm again, choose the new smaller cluster of buildings so that it includes the Sähkötalo building.\n",
    "    - Find the center of this cluster and calculate the largest distance from a building in this cluster to its center.\n",

    "- Once you have trained a KMeansModel, the coordinates for the cluster centers, and the cluster indexes for individual buildings can be accessed through the model object (`clusterCenters`, `summary.predictions`).\n",
